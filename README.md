## 🗨️ Acknowledgments
I would like to thank [MJ Phillip](https://www.github.com/MJPhillip) for giving me permission to use this project in this exam and [Connor O'Brien](https://www.github.com/cnnrbrn) for helping me the time when I got stuck with login authentication issues. Special thanks also goes to [Tiffany](https://www.github.com/utvaer) for helping me when I had problems with POST requests and [Priscila](https://www.github.com/pkderlam87). Nor will I forget to thank both of them the times when I needed guidance on how to deploy Strapi to Heroku to make the database go online, in addition to all the support and feedback you have given me so far. 
<br><br>
I also want to thank the client so much for giving me this excellent timing opportunity, and for having the trust and faith in me 🙏
