Part 2 of 2 

<!-- Intro -->
## Project brief
**Torf's Gallery of Art** is an online gallery that showcases a collection of artwork created by the (hobby) artist Torfinn Lie that he has been working on since he retired from his last job. Oil painting is a major technique he uses in most of his paintings, in addition to acrylic painting used occasionally. Torfinn is inspired by his homeland's maritime- and nature landscapes, which is reflected in many of his art. This website will serve as his personal art portfolio where he hopes he can come into contact with other art enthusiasts.

Visitors can currently search for paintings based on existing titles and exsisting categories, and to access specific details about each painting being published either from `home` and/or `gallery` page. Users can also send messages directly to the artist through contact form and send him a request/assignment from enquiry form.

While website owner and admin users have the ability to add new paintings, which will be published both on the physical website and will be displayed in the API json.
Admins can also access list of enquiries and contacts, in addition to delete enquiry requests and contact messages.
